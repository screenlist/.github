# Screen List

Screen List is a community supported open database of South African films, television series, the companies and people who make them. The platform allows various forms of filmmaking and their media to co-exist. Projects in development, pre-production, production, post-production or released can also be added. The platform strives to keep track of films' production journey from early stages to the finished product. The companies producing, distributing and the people involved in the filmmaking process can all be added to the platform. No one left behind. Contributions to the database can be made by anyone.
